This is a Node.js command-line utility that takes the path to the ad creative file and produces a file with the creative's image.

## Getting Started

First, install packages:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the `creative-scanner` utility:

```bash
node creative-scanner input_file.txt output_file.png
```

Where `input_file.txt` is a path to the input file and `output_file.png` is a path where output image file will be saved.
